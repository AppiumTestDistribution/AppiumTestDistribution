This is an Appium plugin designed to manage and create driver session on connected android devices and iOS Simulators.

**Why Appium Device Farm?**

- Automatically detects connected Android, iOS Simulators and Real devices before session creation and maintains it in device pool.
- Dynamically allocates a free device from device pool while creating driver session.
- Updates the device pool with a new device during test execution.
- Allocates random ports for parallel execution.
- Remote execution
- Async lockup for device changes.
