This framework provides a simple way to run tests on multiple devices in parallel. 
It is designed to be used with [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) and [TestNG](https://testng.org/doc/).

**Why ATD?**

- Automatically detects connected Android, iOS Simulators and Real devices before session creation and maintains it in device pool.
- Dynamically allocates a free device from device pool while creating driver session.
- Updates the device pool with a new device during test execution.
- Allocates random ports for parallel execution.
- Remote execution
- Async lockup for device changes.
